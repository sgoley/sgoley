### Hi there 👋

<!--
**sgoley/sgoley** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🔭 Experience building data products that are business oriented for companies like [Sofi](https://www.sofi.com/)🏦, [Avenue One](https://www.avenueone.com/)🏘️, B2B payments automation 💳 with [Finexio](https://finexio.com), Healthcare Marketing at [ARS](https://www.advancedrecoverysystems.com/), and much much more both personal and professional!
- 📚 I'm currently doing personal projects primarily to expand my knowledge of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)✨, [docker](https://www.docker.com/)🐋, [duckdb](https://duckdb.org/)🦆, [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)🎈, [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/)🔎, [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/)❄️ and a few other things!
- 💾 My primary coding language these days is [python](https://www.python.org)🐍 but continuously looking to improve as I learn more about [Golang]([url](https://go.dev)),  javascript via [bun](https://bun.com), solidity via [foundry](https://getfoundry.sh), and [zig](https://ziglang.org) (because [software should be perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4oYSByyRak)?!).
- 🪪 I've gotten a few certifications [here](https://www.credly.com/users/scott-goley) and [there](https://www.salesforce.com/trailblazer/sgoley) along the way.
- 🛠️ My current favorite productivity tools lately are: [Obsidian Notes📝](https://obsidian.md/),  [Mermaid Charts🗺️](https://mermaid.live/edit), [Devdocs📚](https://devdocs.io/), and [Claude Code🤖](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code)
